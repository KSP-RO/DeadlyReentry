	description = Upgrades planes with a ceramic skin capable of orbital reentry. Thousands of pieces of discarded ceramic pottery and glass bottles are ground into a fine powder and then mixed with baking powder and soda water from the Kerman Bottled Soda Water plant. The resulting foamy mass is then baked in a giant kiln and cut into squares before being applied to the space plane. Lab theorizes that it SHOULD protect your planes from reentry. Probably.
